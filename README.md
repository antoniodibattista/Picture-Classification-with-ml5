## About the Project
With this project, you can build and train a real-time image classification model. Everything happens within your browser and hence, you do not need additional resources like a significant amount of time or high computational power. This project was built using open source libraries like ml5.js and p5.js.


Instructions on how to use the interface are given on the respective screens.
